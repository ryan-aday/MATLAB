Problem 1 [70 pts]: Given the matrix A = [ 1 -1 3; -1 2 5; 3 0 -4] and vector b=[ 1; 0; -2],
write a Matlab scritp named problem1.m that computes and the following:
(a) [10 pts] The norm n=|b| of the vector b
(b) [10 pts] The minimum value amin of the matrix A
(c) [10 pts] The maximum value amax of the matrix A
(d) [10 pts] The determinat D of the matrix A
(e) [10 pts] The matrix B which is the inverse of A
(f) [10 pts] The column vector x which is the solution of the linear system A x = b
(g) [10 pts] The residual error err=|B x- b| for the solution vector x computed in (f)



Problem 2: Write a Matlab scritp named problem2.m that performed the following operations:
(a) [5 pts] Load the file input.xls, which has 2 columns of fixed width
(b) [5 pts] Store the first column of input.dat in a vector x
(c) [5 pts] Store the second column of input.dat in a vector y
(d) [5 pts] Compute the size N of the vector x
(d) [10 pts] Compute a scalar S that stores the sum of all elements x(i) that are larger than y(i)
You must use the FOR and IF statemnts to create a loop and decision structure to verify that x(i)>y(i)
