MAKE SURE THAT YOU ENTERED YOUR SBUID CORRECTLY
Solving the problems 1 and 2 should take about 1 hour and 15 minutes.
You must upload your scripts problem1.m and problem.2 on blackboard by 2:40PM ET.
Problem 1 [50 pts]: The data for your problem are:

The 3-by-3 matrix A whose elements are
A(1,1) =  2,  A(1,2) =  0,  A(1,3) =  4,
A(2,1) =  1,  A(2,2) = -1,  A(2,3) =  8,
A(3,1) =  4,  A(3,2) =  7,  A(3,3) = -3,

the column vector b = [  5;   9;  -1],
and column vector c = [ -2;   3;   0],

Write a Matlab scritp named problem1.m that computes the following:
(a) [10 pts] The vector v=A*(b+3*c)-|c| where |c| is the norm of the vector c
(b) [10 pts] The 3-by-3 matrix B whose elements are B(i,j)= 1.5*cos(A(i,j)+2*sin(A(i,j))
(c) [5 pts] The maximum value Mmax of the matrix M=B-A, where B is the matrix created in 1(b)
(d) [5 pts] The determinant D of the matrix P=2.5*A
(e) [5 pts] The matrix Q which is the inverse of the matrix P created in 1(d)
(f) [15 pts] The column vector x which is the solution of the linear system 2*A x - c=0

Problem 2  [50 pts]: Write a Matlab scritp named problem2.m that performs the following operations:

(a) [5 pts] Load to Matlab the file input.txt, which has numerical data in columns of fixed width
(b) [5 pts] Use the Matlab command size() to determine the number of rows Nr and number of columns Nc of your input data
(c) [10 pts] Store in a column vector x the fourth column of the file input.txt
(d) [15 pts] Compute a scalar R equal to the sum of the cosines of each and every element of x
(e) [15 pts] Compute a scalar S that stores the sum of all elements of the vector x that are larger than 5.38
You must use the FOR and IF statemnts to create a loop and decision structure to solve problem 2(e)
